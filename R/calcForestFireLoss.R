#' @title calcForestFireLoss
#'
#' @description Assembles annual forest area loss by driver, in Mha per year, from one of
#' two driver sources, with the FAO FRA 2020 fire column bound on as `overall`.
#'
#' @param source Driver data to use. `"GFW"` (default) is the WRI/Google DeepMind 1 km
#' dominant-driver product of Sims et al. (2025), crossed with UMD/Hansen annual tree
#' cover loss per country - see [readGFWLossByDriver()]. `"Curtis"` is the hand-transcribed
#' Table 1 of Curtis et al. (2018), seven regions spread over countries by FRA forest area;
#' it computes as before, from the corrected table.
#' @param period Years averaged to give the annual rate, for `source = "GFW"` only. The
#' default 2015:2024 is the most recent complete decade in the GFW record. The Curtis
#' source carries a single 2001-2015 mean and ignores this argument.
#'
#' @details The `overall` column is the FRA 2020 fire series averaged over its own years,
#' 2000-2017, not over `period` - the two records barely overlap. That is the behaviour this
#' function has always had, and `overall` is loaded but never read on the GAMS side.
