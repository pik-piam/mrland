# The only driver classes that belong in f35_forest_lost_share. The parameter is not a
# deforestation rate: module 35 moves the "lost" area out of mature secondary-forest age
# classes and out of primary forest and straight back into the youngest age classes
# (35_natveg/pot_forest_may24/presolve.gms), so total forest area is conserved and only the
# age structure resets. A class therefore qualifies only if it (a) leaves the land as forest
# and (b) is not something MAgPIE already decides for itself:
#
#   permanent agriculture       - permanent conversion, and endogenous via vm_lu_transitions
#   hard commodities            - permanent conversion (mining)
#   logging                     - regrowth, but endogenous via v35_hvarea_* and module 73
#   settlements & infrastructure- permanent conversion, and module 34 sets the urban pool
#   unknown                     - unattributable
#
# Those five are the observational counterpart to quantities the model solves for, and are
# published through mrvalidation::calcValidTreeCoverLoss() instead, where they benchmark the
# model rather than parameterise it. Feeding them in here would double count.

#' @title calcForestFireLoss
#'
#' @description Assembles annual forest area loss by driver, in Mha per year, from one of
#' two driver sources, with the FAO FRA 2020 fire column bound on as `overall`.
#'
#' @param source Driver data to use. `"GFW"` (default) is the WRI/Google DeepMind 1 km
#' dominant-driver product of Sims et al. (2025), crossed with UMD/Hansen annual tree
#' cover loss per country - see [readGFWLossByDriver()]. `"Curtis"` is the hand-transcribed
#' Table 1 of Curtis et al. (2018), seven regions spread over countries by FRA forest area;
#' it computes as before, from the corrected table.
#' @param period Years averaged to give the annual rate, for `source = "GFW"` only. The
#' default 2015:2024 is the most recent complete decade in the GFW record. The Curtis
#' source carries a single 2001-2015 mean and ignores this argument.
#'
#' @details For `source = "GFW"` only the three driver classes that MAgPIE does not
#' model endogenously are returned - see `gfwModelDrivers` at the top of this file for
#' which, and why the others are routed to mrvalidation instead.
#'
#' The `overall` column is the FRA 2020 fire series averaged over its own years,
#' 2000-2017, not over `period` - the two records barely overlap. That is the behaviour this
#' function has always had, and `overall` is loaded but never read on the GAMS side.
