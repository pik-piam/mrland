#' @title calcForestLossShare
#'
#' @description Calculates which share of forest area is lost per year to each driver of
#' forest loss.
#'
#' @param source Driver data to use, `"GFW"` (default) or `"Curtis"`. See
#' [calcForestLossByDriver()].
#' @param period Years averaged to give the annual rate, for `source = "GFW"` only.
#'
#' @details For `source = "GFW"` numerator and denominator come from the same product at the
#' same canopy threshold: UMD tree cover loss by driver over UMD tree cover extent in 2000,
#' the base the loss is measured on. For `source = "Curtis"` the denominator stays FRA 2020
#' naturally regenerating forest area in 2010, reproducing the previous parameterisation
#' exactly. The `overall` column (FRA fire area) is divided by the same denominator as the
#' drivers of its source and exceeds 1 in a few savanna countries; GAMS loads it but never reads
#' it. Shares above 1 are clamped to 1; for a driver column this also warns with the country names.
