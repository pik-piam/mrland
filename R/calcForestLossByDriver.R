# Driver classes that reach f35_forest_lost_share. Module 35 resets the age structure of the
# "lost" area (the land stays forest) and module 52 books the flux as land-use-change CO2, so a
# class qualifies only if it leaves the land as forest, is not decided endogenously by MAgPIE,
# and is a land-use rather than a natural process. Of the eight GFW classes only shifting
# cultivation passes. The others are published by mrvalidation::calcValidTreeCoverLoss:
# permanent agriculture, hard commodities and settlements remove the forest, logging is
# MAgPIE's own timber harvest, wildfire and other natural disturbances are natural.

#' @title calcForestLossByDriver
#'
#' @description Annual forest area loss by driver, Mha per year, from the Sims et al. (2025)
#' driver product (`source = "GFW"`, default) or the Curtis et al. (2018) table
#' (`source = "Curtis"`), with the FRA 2020 fire series bound on as `overall`.
#'
#' @param source `"GFW"` (default) or `"Curtis"`. Curtis computes as before, from the
#' corrected Curtis et al. (2018) table.
#' @param period Years averaged into the annual rate, GFW only (default 2015:2024). Curtis
#' carries a single 2001-2015 mean.
#'
#' @details For GFW only the classes in `gfwModelDrivers` are returned. `overall` is the FRA
#' fire series averaged over its own years (2000-2017), as before; GAMS loads it but never
#' reads it.
