#' @title calcMulticroppingSuitability
#'
#' @description Calculates which grid cells are potentially suitable for
#'              multiple cropping activities under rainfed and irrigated conditions.
#'              Calculation is based on the length of the growing period determined by
#'              monthly grassland gross primary production (GPP).
#'
#' @param selectyears    Years to be returned
#' @param lpjml          LPJmL version required for respective inputs: natveg or crop
#' @param climatetype    Switch between different climate scenarios or
#'                       historical baseline "GSWP3-W5E5:historical"
#' @param suitability    "endogenous": suitability for multiple cropping determined
#'                                    by rules based on grass and crop productivity
#'                       "exogenous": suitability for multiple cropping given by
#'                                    GAEZ data set
#' @param sectoral       "kcr" MAgPIE crops, and "lpj" LPJmL crops
