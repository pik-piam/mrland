\usage{
calcConservationPriorities(
  consvBaseYear = "y1750",
  cells = "lpjcell",
  nclasses = "seven"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{consvBaseYear}{Reference year for land conservation. Chosing "y1750", for instance, means that
the reference land use is based on the year 1750 ('pre-industrial') so
land use can be restored to the pre-industrial state in conservation priority areas.
Any year available in the LUH3 data set can be chosen. Historic land use in the LUH3 data
is based on the HYDE data base.
The choice "y2020" provides a special case, in which reference land use is based on the 2020 ESA CCI LULC map,
derived at a spatial resolution of 300 x 300 Meter.}

\item{cells}{number of cells of landmask (select "magpiecell" for 59199 cells or "lpjcell" for 67420 cells)}

\item{nclasses}{Options are either "seven" or "nine".
\itemize{
\item "seven" separates primary and secondary forest and includes "crop", "past", "forestry",
"primforest", "secdforest", "urban" and "other"
\item "nine" adds the separation of pasture and rangelands, as well as a differentiation of
primary and secondary non-forest vegetation and therefore returns "crop", "past", "range",
"forestry", "primforest", "secdforest", "urban", "primother" and "secdother"
